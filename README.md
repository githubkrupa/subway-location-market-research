Subway, a prominent fast-food franchise, is considering opening a new store in an amusement park in Virginia. Due
to a 25% decline in foot traffic over the past few years, Subway aims to optimize its next location by ensuring a
steady stream of customers and maximizing profitability. To do this, they plan to partner with amusement parks to
monetize the foot traffic in suburban as well as city areas. The goal of this analysis is to evaluate several amusement
parks based on visitor data.
